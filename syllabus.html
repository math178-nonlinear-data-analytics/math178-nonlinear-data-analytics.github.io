            &#9679; <b><i>Reading Summary</i></b> <br />
            To encourage the goal of reading active research in the field and to
            help students conduct literature search for their final projects,
            each student is required to read the assigned papers (or find papers
            related) and write a summary of 1-2 pages. The summary should be
            turned in at the start of class. The summaries must be clear and
            demonstrate that you understand the paper with a high degree of
            confidence. Credit will be given on a 0-10 scale for each summary.
            Your summary should be done at a high level, and should focus on the
            main point of the readings (i.e. avoid complicated math). As long as
            your summary is reasonable, you will be given full credit.<br /><br />
            &#9679; <b><i>Homework</i></b> <br />
            The homework is due
            <b
              >everyday when there will be no term project related item to be
              submitted</b
            >. There will be two parts for each assignment: math and coding. The
            homework is split approximately evenly between mathematical analysis
            and extension of our course material and application of algorithms.
            <br /><br />
            For coding: You are highly recommended to use Python3. For each
            problem, the starter code and the sample solution are implemented in
            Python3. All the results and graphs for the sample solutions were
            produced under Python 3.6.0 under macOS Mojave; different versions
            of Python or system environment may produce different results. You
            are also welcome to use other programming languages, but the starter
            code is not provided in other formats.
            <br /><br />
            <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a> and
            <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> are two important
            python libraries to know for coding assignment for this course. You
            might also want to look at
            <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> for generating
            plots. If you never used these libraries before, make sure you check
            out the tutorials online before starting the first assignment.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Note:</i> <br />
            1) When doing the coding problem for each homework set, you are not
            allowed to use any machine learning algorithms implemented by
            external libraries, such as LinearRegression in sklearn. However,
            you may use these algorithms in your final project.<br /><br />
            2) Each homework has both pdf and tex versions. To have the tex
            files successfully compiled, make sure that you have downloaded both
            <a href="homework/macros.tex">macros.tex</a> and
            <a href="homework/hmcpset.cls">hmcpset.cls</a> and put them and the
            hw tex file under same folder. <br />
            If you have any questions with regard to the compilation of the tex
            files, feel free to ask the TA for help.<br /><br />
            3) For each coding problem, please submit your code to GitHub;
            please print out any graph or printing statements and submit them
            with the written part.<br /><br />
            &#9679; <b><i>Midterm Progress Report</i></b> <br />
            The midterm progress report is to summarize the status, progress,
            and likely future for the final project. The detailed description
            and requirements for the report can be found under the "Final
            Project" tab.<br /><br />
            &#9679; <b><i>Final Project</i></b> <br />
            The final project is the largest component of the course. Each
            student will discover, explore, and attack a real world problem of
            your choosing. The detailed description and requirements for the
            final project can be found under the "Final Project" tab.
            <br /><br />
            &#9679; <b><i>GitHub</i></b> <br />
            As we stated in the course overview, students are expected to become
            comfortable with Github. Hence, each student is required to create a
            Github account for coding assignment submission and final project
            submission. If you already have a Github account, that's perfect. If
            not, please create a personal Github account and go over the
            tutorials online.<br />
            <i>Note:</i> Please make sure to send the username of your Github
            account to TA for homework grading.
          </p>
          <h3>Classroom Policies:</h3>
          <p>
            &#9679; <b><i>Attendence</i></b> <br />
            Attendence for each lecture is mandatory and is expected of all
            class members. if you're going to miss a lecture, it is neccessary
            for you to inform the instructor as soon as possible. You are also
            responsible for obtaining notes from another class member.
            <br /><br />
            &#9679; <b><i>Devices</i></b> <br />
            You are welcome to use your computer or tablet for note-taking (the
            PowerPoint slides will also be posted for your convenience).
          </p>
          <h3>Diabilities:</h3>
          <p>
            Students who need disability-related accommodations are encouraged
            to discuss this with the instructor as soon as possible.
