	Feel free to work with other students, but make sure you write up the homework
	and code on your own (no copying homework \textit{or} code; no pair programming).
	Feel free to ask students or instructors for help debugging code or whatever else,
	though.\\
	
	\textit{Note:} You need to create a Github account for submission of the coding part of the homework. Please create a repository on Github to hold all your code and include your Github account username as part of the answer to the coding problems.
